			<h2>Our Boat </h2>
			<p>The Honu (Hawaiian for sea turtle) is a Westsail 32. She is a 40ft cutter rigged sloop built in 1975,
				beautifully maintained and in Bristol fashion. The Honu's previous voyages include the South Pacific,
				New Zealand and back to Hawaii. She carries only 6 guests and is a very safe and sea-worthy vessel.</p>
			<p> The Westsail 32 is famously known as,
				"The boat that launched a thousand dreams"
				and the sailing vessel that survived the "Perfect Storm".</p>
