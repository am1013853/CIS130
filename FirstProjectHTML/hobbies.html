                <h3>play video games.</h3>
                <p>I enjoy playing games since I was a kid. It started from having my first Game Boy at age 5, then
                    having access to online games ever since. I used to play a lot of mobile games such as Mobile
                    Legends, PUBG, and CODM when I was in high school. Then, when the pandemic started, I began to play
                    PC games such as Valorant and Stardew Valley.<br>

            <li>
                <h3>watch a series or documentary.</h3>
                <p>When I want to take my mind off of everything that's happening, I just go watch something on Netflix
                    or on free online sites.<br>

                    <br> Fun fact: I love watching or listening to snippets of True Crime Documentaries on Tiktok or
                    Reels.

                <h3>play with my little brother.</h3>
                <p>During weekends or on days he doesn't have school, he always asks to play with me. I love my little
                    brother!<br>

                    <br> The age gap between my little brother and I is almost as same as the age gap with me and my
                    mom.
